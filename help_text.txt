General command to fetch meme:

/meme r-<subreddit> m-<method>

NOTE: The order of subreddit and method can be changed but spacing needs to take very seriously. Spacing between 'r-' and subreddit name can cause undiresed results. Same goes with 'm-' and method.

METHOD: In general a subreddit has 3 kind of posts, 'hot', 'new' and 'top'. These methods are allowed. 

SUBREDDIT: Name of subreddit. Please provide correct name else subreddit API will through error and you cann't get desired result.

DEFAULTS: By default subreddit is set to 'dankmemes' and method is set to 'hot', so typing nothing in field of 'r-' and/or 'm-' will give you default setting result. Moreover you may get a meme by just sending '/meme'

Examples: 
1. /meme
2. /meme r-dankmemes 
3. /meme m-new
4. /meme r-meme m-hot

HAPPY CODING
