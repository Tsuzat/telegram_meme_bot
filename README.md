# TELEGRAM MEME BOT
To create a telegram bot [read this](https://core.telegram.org/bots/#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot). Once the bot is created you'll get a API TOKEN. For reddit API, you need to create [an app](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps). You'll be provided _client_id_, _client_secret_. Using these credentials and your reddit _username_ and _password_, you can fetch data with reddit API. 

## Steps to follow
- Get telegram bot TOKEN and reddit _client_id_, _client_secret_
- Make a .env file where you need to write following with correct data.
    ```text
    TOKEN=
    client_id=
    client_secret=
    user=
    password=
    ```
- Install python 3.8 or higher
- You need to install important packages. Run following 
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- run main.py
